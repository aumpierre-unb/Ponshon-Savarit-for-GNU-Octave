function S=RS2q(data,X,R,S)
    # Syntax:
    #
    # q=RS2q(data,X,q,R)
    #
    # RS2q computes the feed quality
    #  of a distillation column
    #  using the Ponchon-Savarit method given
    #  a x-h-y-H matrix of the liquid and the vapor fractions
    #  at equilibrium and their enthalpies,
    #  the vector of the fractions of the products and the feed,
    #  the reflux ratio at the top of the column and
    #  the reflux ratio at the bottom of the column.
    # RS2q is a main function of
    #  the ponchon-savarit toolbox for GNU Octave.
    #
    # Examples:
    #
    # # Compute the reflux ratio at the bottom
    # # of a distillation column for oxygen and nitrogen given
    # # the composition of the distillate is 88 %,
    # # the composition of the feed is 46 %,
    # # the composition of the column's bottom product is 11 %,
    # # the feed quality is 54 % and
    # # the reflux ratio at the top of the column is 2:
